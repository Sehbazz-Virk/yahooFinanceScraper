Quick script that currently only pulls trailing P/E ratio from well formatted inputs
where the expected url exists on yahoo finance. Not robust or complete!

HOW TO USE:
* make sure you have python3 installed
* run the following command in this folder:
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
* Note I highly reccomend using virtual environments!
* run the program using python3 scraper.py
